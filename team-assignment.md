# General Summary

- This is an application that creates a DnD character with a combination of race and classes (GUI requirement),
- The user would be able to select the race/class through either cycling them with a button or using a drop-down box. 
- Changing race or class will change the portrait displayed on the left of the window
- The GUI should include a random option for users to randomize the race and class. This should be implemented as a class (randomizeCharacter.java). 
- The GUI should include a button next to the class and race to let the user read information about the according to class and race if they wish to do so.
- This should be implemented as a class (displayInformation.java). 
- The GUI should include a button that reset the character and return it to the default creation (Human, Warrior?). 
- This should be implemented as a class (resetCharacter.java). The GUI should include a button that lets the user choose the characterâ€™s gender. 
- This should be implemented as a class? (changeCharacterGender.java).
- Let the app have text files that store all the information about the class and race about the creation of the character. 
- Maybe include this also for the stats? Use generic collections to store the starting item(s) of Legendary Character and the amount of it.
